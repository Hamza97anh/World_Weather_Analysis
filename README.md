# World_Weather_Analysis

## Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter
- APIs
- Google maps

## Project Overview

Using APIs, we collect hotel and resort data, then weather data using google APIs, and plotting them on a Gmap instance to generate a map that combines that data into one visual tool for the observer. The map can than be used to explore possible vacations destinations based on their preferred weather.

## Results

The first step was plotting the weather on our map

Next we add the vactions and resort spots on the map

Finally, we create a popup menu to display our data informations pulled from Gmaps API data

## Summary

APIs are the friend of any data analyist looking to collect market relevent data. Any research is best served by having current and relevent data to best predict trends of the future. This API demonstration is good for displaying our data to the audience while the data goes through more processing and analysis to answer the research question.
